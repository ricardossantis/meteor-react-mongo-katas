# Meteor, React, and MongoDB Ultralearning Project

Welcome to the Meteor, React, and MongoDB Ultralearning Project! This project is designed to help you master these technologies through hands-on practice and repetition.

## Project Structure

This project is divided into three main sections: Meteor, React, and MongoDB. Each section contains six levels of tasks, with each level increasing in complexity.

## Getting Started

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js and npm
- Meteor
- Git
- A text editor or IDE, like Visual Studio Code

## How to Use This Repository

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory of the technology and level you want to work on.
3. Read the README file for the task description and requirements.
4. Write your solution in the provided starter code file.
5. Run the tests to check your solution.

## Resources

Here are some resources to help you along the way:

- Meteor Documentation
- React Documentation
- MongoDB Documentation

Remember, the key to mastering these technologies is practice and repetition. Don't rush through the tasks. Take your time to understand the concepts and write the best code you can. Happy coding! ðŸš€


## Katas

**Meteor:**
1. **Level 1:** Write a Meteor method that returns a static string.
2. **Level 2:** Create a Meteor method that takes an argument and returns it.
3. **Level 3:** Develop a Meteor method that interacts with a MongoDB collection (like inserting a document).
4. **Level 4:** Write a Meteor method that performs a complex query on a MongoDB collection.
5. **Level 5:** Create a Meteor publication that publishes documents from a MongoDB collection.
6. **Level 6:** Develop a Meteor method that calls an external API and stores the result in a MongoDB collection.

**React:**
1. **Level 1:** Create a functional component in React that displays a prop.
2. **Level 2:** Develop a React component that maintains its own state using the `useState` hook.
3. **Level 3:** Implement a Higher-Order Component (HOC) that wraps around another component and passes props to it.
4. **Level 4:** Create a React component that uses the `useEffect` hook to perform side effects.
5. **Level 5:** Develop a context provider in React using the `createContext` and `useContext` hooks.
6. **Level 6:** Implement a complex React component that uses multiple hooks and context.

**MongoDB:**
1. **Level 1:** Write a MongoDB query that inserts a document into a collection.
2. **Level 2:** Develop a MongoDB query that finds documents in a collection based on certain criteria.
3. **Level 3:** Write a MongoDB query that updates certain fields of a document in a collection.
4. **Level 4:** Create a MongoDB query that deletes a document from a collection based on certain criteria.
5. **Level 5:** Write a MongoDB aggregation pipeline that groups documents by a certain field and calculates the count.
6. **Level 6:** Develop a complex MongoDB query that uses advanced features like text search or geospatial queries.
